        <h2>Architecture falls into teh science of designing buildings.</h2>
        <p>I am intrested in Architecture because I love buildings.
            I enjoy looking at the features and taking in the beauty of them.
            I also enjoy coming up with floor plans, layouts, and constructing them.
