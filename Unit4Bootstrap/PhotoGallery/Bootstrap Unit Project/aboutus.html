                    has been a major contributor to this town and his core motto is, "Having Fun is the foundation to a happy life". Once Don heard of
                    the city proposing the idea of a Fair, Don bought in very quickly. Him and his Son, David, brainstormed, planned, and executed Their
                    ideas for this Fair and each year they get more Bold. Sadly, Don passed on his buisness, name, and legacy to his son last year, when
