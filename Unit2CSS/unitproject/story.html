           <h3>Cheese?</h3> 
           <p>Yes, Cheese. The dairy product that is often overlooked. Cheese is mainly just a topping or add-on,
             never the star of the show exculding cheese boards. Just a dipping sauce or slice placed on sandwiches or burgers. It has been hidden 
            by other flavors.</p>

                <h3>Just?</h3>
                <p>Cheese is not JUST anything. Cheese is anything. A cube, a slice, a wheel, a ball, a wedge.
                 Cheese is whatever it wants to be.</p>
                <p class="word">Cheese is the ULTIMATE PEOPLE PLEASER.</p>
                <p> It spends decades aging just to please people with its flavor,
                 yet to be still overlooked. It is melted, molded, fried, smashed, and shredded so it can be eaten.
                There are even thousands of diffrent types from around the world. Yet people treat it like its hardly there.</p>

                <h3>So?</h3>
                <p>So! Nearly 42 pounds of cheese is consumed by the average American annually.</p>
                <blockquote>"In 2022, the average consumer in the United States ate about 41.8 pounds of cheese. (Statisca.com)"</blockquote>
                <p>There were 333.33 million people living in America in 2022. That means 13,999,860,000 pounds of Cheese was consumed, assuming everyone
                ate 42 pounds of cheese that year.</p>
                <p>It take 10 pounds of Cows milk to craft 1 Pound of cheese. That means 139,998,600,000 pounds of cows milk was used to make
                     the amount of cheese americans ate in 2022. A cow can produce nearly 11,000 gallons of milk in its lifetime, meaning 12,727,145 cows
                      were used to produce the milk needed to make the cheese.</p>
                      <h5>Just for the cheese to be overlooked when its put on the plate.</h5>

                <h3>Thats not that much!</h3>
                <p>42 pound is about a Average 4 year old. The average American consumes a 4 year old, in Cheese, each year without noticing.
                Nobody batts a eye at the thought that cheese is on your burger, sandwich, soup, potatoes, or even on chips; but if a 4 year old
                was there instead there would be more than just stares.

                <h3>Cheese is Cheese, its does not matter.</h3>
                <p>Correct! Cheese is Cheese no matter the form. Whether its a wheel or a slice or even cubed or diced, it is still Cheese.
                    People will still see it a call it 'Cheese' no matter its correct name. It is glanced over again and again although its
                    only goal is to please you. It will become blue and green but it still is eaten, without a compliment to its pretty colors.
                    Cheese will get new jewerlry like herbs and spices to update its taste, but it is still eaten with only a slim possibilty for a 
                    compliment on the unique flavoring.
