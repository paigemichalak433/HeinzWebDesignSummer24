        <p1>Last Summer, I went on a family trip Out West.
        We visited many National Parks, like Yellowstone and Glacier. After our week long excursion we drove to Canada.
        In Canada, we explored Lake Louise, Jasper, and Banff. I got to go on many long hikes through the Rocky Mountains.
        I would reccomend a trip like this for everyone, because it was very soothing to connect with Nature.
        I cherished the time I spent with my Family and believe it brought us closer together. </p1>
